The staff are really friendly and the food is a decent sized portion. I had a chicken and lamb rice platter, which was really great, my only complaint is that there wasn't enough sauce with the hummus, but at $12, it wasn't bad for the area at all. The chicken and lamb weren't dry and there was plenty of flavor. On top of that, since I dined in, I got a free bottle of water with the meal.",
